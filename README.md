# Tic-Tac-Toe in Unity

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game created with Unity! This project allows you to play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game against an AI opponent. You can choose to play as either "X" (cross) or "O" (circle) and challenge yourself with the AI.

## Features

- Choose to play as "X" or "O."
- Compete against an AI opponent.
- Classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid.
- Simple and intuitive gameplay.

## Gameplay

1. **Choose Your Symbol:** When the game starts, you have the option to select whether you want to play as "X" or "O."

2. **Take Your Turn:** Click on an empty cell in the grid to make your move. The goal is to be the first to form a line of three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

3. **Play Against the AI:** Challenge the AI opponent, which will take its turns strategically.

4. **Win or Draw:** The game will declare a winner when a player gets three in a row or when the board is full with no winner, resulting in a draw.
